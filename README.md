# tech-blog
## Description
- My motivation for this project was to create a place where I can store blog posts about coding.
- I built this project to further develop my knowledge of MVC and how to connect the front end with the back end.
- This app solves the problem of having a safe and secure application that can store blog posts and user data.
- I learned a lot about MVC and how to use Handlebars to render data on the page. I also learned how to correctly seed databases and connect to the frontend.
